# Player Movement Patch

![Logo](logo.png)

A mod for 7 Days to Die.

This mod patches the game to fix issues with player movement.

In particular, some issues related to sprinting occur when the sprint lock option is disabled. Therefore, if the sprint lock option is enabled, this mod will have no effect on sprint behavior.

- Fix an issue where tapping a key briefly would cause the player to continue sprinting even after the key was released. (This behavior is commonly referred to as Toggle Sprint, and this Mod also disables Toggle Sprint if the Sprint Lock option is disabled.)
- Fix an issue where tapping a key briefly would cause the player to continue sprinting even after the key was released.
- Fixed an issue where releasing the sprint button after opening a container or inventory with the sprint button held down would cause the container or inventory to remain in sprint state even after closing it.
- Fix an issue where holding down the jump key would cause the player to jump again immediately after landing.
