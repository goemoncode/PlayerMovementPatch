# Player Movement Patch

![Logo](logo.png)

A mod for 7 Days to Die.

This mod patches the game to fix issues with player movement.

- Fix an issue where tapping a key briefly would cause the player to continue sprinting even after the key was released, even if sprint lock was disabled.
- Fix an issue where holding down the jump key would cause the player to jump again immediately after landing.
